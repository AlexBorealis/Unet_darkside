Matplotlib

# Building your network
Use the layers to build your preferred network configuration in *network.py*

# Hyperparameters
Set the appropriate values for the hyper-parameters listed in *hyperparameters.py*

# Train
Run *train.py* once all the configuration is done to train your network

# Testing
Run *predict.py* for the getting the appropriate Sample IDs
